# Traffic-Light-Model

For my grade 11 Computer Engineering final project, I made a model of a four way intersection that is controlled with a PIC 24FV32KA microcontroller. There are four traffic lights and a stepper motor for a railroad crossing gate. The lights flash yellow in the direction of pedestrian crossing. If the crossing button is pressed, the stepper motor lowers the gate and the lights flash red. There is also flashing green lights if the advanced green button is pressed.
